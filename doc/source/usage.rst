Using Fast-Trips
==================



Localization Process
--------------------

Potential Steps:
 1. Prepare local network and demand data
 2. Prepare performance/validation metrics
 3. Posit initial set of configuration parameters for an *initial validation*
 4. Evaluate performance of fast-trips compared to validation data
 5. Re-evaluate steps 1-3 until you  are satisfied with the output of step 4

The following are examples from the localization process in the San Francisco Bay Area

If there exists a survey with transit path details that can be converted to the `dyno-path <https://github.com/osplanning-data-standards/dyno-path>`_ format as well, Fast-Trips results can be summarized and validated against the survey observations. One such effort has been made to validate Fast-Trips output against two surveys in San Francisco Bay Area - Transit On-Board Survey (OBS) and California Household Travel Survey (CHTS).
The scripts and detailed instructions to process the surveys and generate summary dashboards in Tableau can be found in the `fast-trips-validation <http://github.com/sfcta/fast-trips-validation>`_ repository.
